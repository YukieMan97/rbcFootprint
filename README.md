## By Bonnie Chen, Saakshi Dhingra, Sarah Ferrolino, Yukie Man

## Implemented with Kotlin using Android Studio

## [Project idea](https://ellehacks.hypeinnovation.com/servlet/hype/IMT?documentTableId=9007205813285092533&userAction=Browse&templateName=&documentId=79fdac453205c2bf56ebab16c2a2fd51) : Short Overview

### [Video Presentation of Proposed Prototype](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La_e4lHWCuw&feature=youtu.be)

Our group has incorporated two themes proposed in ElleHacks 2021 into our project: 
- RBC Sponsored Challenge - Rewarding the Environment
- Climate Change and Sustainability

Footprint is an extension of the current RBC rewards app that provides lessons and learning opportunities for the user to learn about the environment and sustainable practices they can implement in their own daily lives.
RBC Footprint slowly creates a conscious consumer by giving them incentives to continue learning about how to make the world a better place one sustainable practice at a time.

Since this project is an extension of an existing application, a login page is not required. However, if RBC Footprint becomes its own application, we would aim for it to look like this. With a reminder that Earth is our beautiful planet and that we are the ones who will make a difference!

The activity tab is what we have focused on. In the existing RBC Rewards application, there is a progress bar to keep track of our recent rewards. We have decided to add two buttons, "DAILY" and "POINTS". "DAILY" is a daily lesson that can be completed for extra points. This will encourage users to learn about different climate change and sustainability everyday, and they're rewarded for it! As for the "POINTS" section, see below for details; this is the main part of the extension.

As a new user, an onboarding prompt will explain the goal of this Footprint extension. RBC Leo is also featured! 

![Tips](https://i.gyazo.com/ead95f41f21f36e45099808bbd6076ba.png)

Everyday, the tips page will be filled with new tips and tricks to reduce waste and encourage conservation. 

![Activity Page: Recycling](https://i.gyazo.com/4a87ebff61f1305bd400628abd138c0a.png)

This activity page is filled with categories where users can select their area of interest and how they can help protect the Earth in their own way. There are topics such as recycling, fast fashion, and renewable energy. Once they have chosen their preferred topic, there will be articles they can read (not implemented) and also go through a short quiz. Completing a quiz succcessfully guarantees more rewards! These quizzes are optional, so the user just wants to read articles, that is also learning!

![Activity Page: Climate Change & Renewable Energy](https://i.gyazo.com/96dc4b35797ec0fe43795e6118478e75.png)

As an example, we have a quiz about fast fashion. Fast fashion is trendy and inexpensive clothing that are mass-produced at a low cost. Because of all these points, there's an increase in overproduction and overconsumption, which does not help our ecological footprint. This is why we have a category about fast fashion. Please see the questions below and how our quiz system works!

![Fast Fashion Q1: correct](https://i.gyazo.com/afb30a2d9e6dcc4e55a7921b87c57e0f.png)

We considered using blue and yellow for our incorrect and correct answers for design purposes and to also represent RBC more. Also, we wanted to account for people with colourblindness. After a mini debate, we decided to stick with green and red colours because they are usually associated with right and wrong answers. Since we are a learning extension, it makes sense to go with this colour scheme. We have also put symbols to indicate between right and wrong answers for those who have colourblindness.

![Fast Fashion Q3](https://i.gyazo.com/7620cbc21314d99a1eb83771f831189b.png)

This quiz contains 3 questions and each question is unique. With these facts and learning experiences, we hope that users feel encouraged to develop good habits in keeping our Earth clean.


## Thanks for reading about our RBC Footprint Extension for the RBC Rewards Application. 

# Special thanks to the RBC Sponsors!
## Our team won the RBC Sponsor Challenge!

We were given the opportunity to present our presentation to the RBC Sponsors in the third round of evaluations! It was a shocking moment for us to all find out we were invited! We were all excited to the point where we got very nervous but thankfully, we had a few minutes to cool down and reset our minds for the presentation. Our team took a lot of time to practice for the YouTube video and this really helped our presentation flow as smoothly as possible. Saakshi also did a great job answering the two of our Sponsor's questions. After that was done, we waited until the Closing Ceremony to hear the results. 

Little did we know... our hard work has paid off! We were selected as the winners of the RBC Challenge!! What exciting news!! Other teams had great ideas and presentations as well but we had the edge in the end. All of us are very grateful for working through this challenge. As most teams I assumed, we stayed up and designed and coded away until time was up. 

So once again, thank you to the RBC Sponsors for giving us a chance and believing in our idea. We are very excited to attend their exclusive virtual RBC event!

# Project Overview:
## Here, I will be talking about my experience (Yukie's experience) with this project and my awesome teammates! This section is mostly for me to reflect on and remember my own experiences with this event.
Day 1:
- We met up on Discord and introduced ourselves before planning out an idea. 
- A little bit about our team... Bonnie is studying Interactive Arts and Technology while doing a minor in Business. Saakshi has an Accounting degree and just finished General Assembly's UXDI bootcamp. As for Sarah and I, we are both studying Computer Science. So our team basically consists of two Backend Developers and two Frontend Developers with experience in Business. 
- Together, we all went through the Ellehacks themes and the one that interested us the most was RBC's challenge: How can RBC rewards programs better help consumers make environmental decisions?
- From there, we knew we wanted to make a educational app where users can learn valuable information about sustainability and climate change.
