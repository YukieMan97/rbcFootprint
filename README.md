## By Bonnie Chen, Saakshi Dhingra, Sarah Ferrolino, Yukie Man

## Implemented in Kotlin with Android Studio

## [Project idea](https://ellehacks.hypeinnovation.com/servlet/hype/IMT?documentTableId=9007205813285092533&userAction=Browse&templateName=&documentId=79fdac453205c2bf56ebab16c2a2fd51) : Short Summary

Our group has incorporated two themes proposed in ElleHacks 2021 into our project: 
- RBC Sponsored Challenge - Rewarding the Environment
- Climate Change and Sustainability

Footprint is an extension of the current RBC rewards app that provides lessons and learning opportunities for the user to learn about the environment and sustainable practices they can implement in their own daily lives.
RBC Footprint slowly creates a conscious consumer by giving them incentives to continue learning about how to make the world a better place one sustainable practice at a time.

Since this project is an extension of an existing application, a login page is not required. However, if RBC Footprint becomes its own application, we would aim for it to look like this. With a reminder that Earth is our beautiful planet and that we are the ones who will make a difference!

The activity tab is what we have focused on. In the existing RBC Rewards application, there is a progress bar to keep track of our recent rewards. We have decided to add two buttons, "DAILY" and "POINTS". "DAILY" is a daily lesson that can be completed for extra points. This will encourage users to learn about different climate change and sustainability everyday, and they're rewarded for it! As for the "POINTS" section, see below for details; this is the main part of the extension.

As a new user, an onboarding prompt will explain the goal of this Footprint extension. RBC Leo is also featured! 

![Tips](https://i.gyazo.com/ead95f41f21f36e45099808bbd6076ba.png)

Everyday, the tips page will be filled with new tips and tricks to reduce waste and encourage conservation. 

![Activity Page: Recycling](https://i.gyazo.com/4a87ebff61f1305bd400628abd138c0a.png)

This activity page is filled with categories where users can select their area of interest and how they can help protect the Earth in their own way. There are topics such as recycling, fast fashion, and renewable energy. Once they have chosen their preferred topic, there will be articles they can read (not implemented) and also go through a short quiz. Completing a quiz succcessfully guarantees more rewards! These quizzes are optional, so the user just wants to read articles, that is also learning!

![Activity Page: Fast Fashion](https://i.gyazo.com/62bada8f00fead15b9a6f4dddf6df0bb.png)

As an example, we have a quiz about fast fashion. Fast fashion is trendy and inexpensive clothing that are mass-produced at a low cost. Because of all these points, there's an increase in overproduction and overconsumption, which does not help our ecological footprint. This is why we have a category about fast fashion. Please see the questions below and how our quiz system works!
